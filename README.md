# Fuel-Optimal Aircraft Allocation in the Brazilian Domestic Air Transportation System

In this repository, we provide an overview of the processed datasets and optimization code behind the fuel-optimal aircraft allocation (FOAA) model, and detail its implementation on the domestic Brazilian air transportation system as a case study.

### 1: Processed Datasets

**Description:** The optimization model takes nine datasets as inputs. Detailed below, these were generated by processing [monthly data](https://www.gov.br/anac/pt-br/assuntos/regulados/empresas-aereas/Instrucoes-para-a-elaboracao-e-apresentacao-das-demonstracoes-contabeis/envio-de-informacoes) from the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), corresponding to all of 2024. Additional information about the ANAC datasets can be found [here](https://www.gov.br/anac/pt-br/assuntos/dados-e-estatisticas/mercado-do-transporte-aereo/demanda-e-oferta).

### 2: Optimization Code

**Description:** The FOAA model can be run under two scenarios: on a yearly basis, using ```FOAA_vYB```, or on a daily basis, using ```FOAA_vDB```. The difference between the two, as their name implies, is that the route passenger and aircraft flying time constraints are met either on aggregate for the year, or daily.

  ```
  - D_day: Average delay on each route, indexed by the day of the week. The 
    dimension of D_day is 333x339x8, since there are 339 airports in 
    the network. The 3rd dimension denotes the day of the week.
    Hence, in D(:,:,i), i = 1 is a Monday, i = 7 is a Sunday, while i = 8 
    refers to the total average.
    The rows of D_day represent the origin airport (OA), while the columns
    denote the destination airport (DA).
  - D_airline: Average delay on each route, indexed by airline (18 different     
    carriers considered in this work).
  - D_airplane: Average delay on each route, indexed by airplane type (41 
    different types considered in this work).
  ```
