### 1: Processed Datasets

**Description:** The optimization model takes nine datasets as inputs. Detailed below, these were generated by processing [monthly data](https://www.gov.br/anac/pt-br/assuntos/regulados/empresas-aereas/Instrucoes-para-a-elaboracao-e-apresentacao-das-demonstracoes-contabeis/envio-de-informacoes) from the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), corresponding to all of 2024. Additional information about the ANAC datasets can be found [here](https://www.gov.br/anac/pt-br/assuntos/dados-e-estatisticas/mercado-do-transporte-aereo/demanda-e-oferta).

* ```Aircraft Statistics.xlsx```: This table contains ten operational performance characteristics for 19 different aircraft types that operated domestically in Brazil during 2024.
  - Operational Performance Characteristics: (1) fleet-wide count; (2) fleet-wide yearly flying times (in days); (3) fleet-wide productivity (in ASKs/day); (4) fuel burn (in L/hr); (5) fuel burn (in L/km); (6) fuel burn (in L/RPK); (7) average number of seats; (8) average stage length (in km); (9) range (in km); and (10) take-off runway length (in m).
  - Aircraft Types: A320NEO; A321NEO; A319CEO; A320CEO; A321CEO; A330-200; A330-900; ATR42-500; ATR72-500; ATR72-600; B737-8; B737-800; B737-500; B737-700; B737-800; B787-9; C208; E195; and E195-E2.
  
* ```Airport Codes.xlsm```: This table contains the ICAO and IATA code, as well as latitude, longitude, and primary runway length (in m) of 169 airports in Brazil (indexed 1 through 169). For example, for Rio de Janeiro Galeao, Index: 34, ICAO Code: SBGL; IATA Code: GIG; Latitute: -22.81; Longitude: -43.25; and Primary Runway Length: 4000m.
  
* ```daily_aircraft_flying_times.csv```: This 19-by-366 matrix contains the total fleet-wide flying times (in days) for each of the 19 different aircraft types and each day of 2024 (indexed 1 through 366). For example, for January 1st and the A320NEO, (1,1), the fleet flew a cumulative amount of 21.84 days, or 524 hours (i.e., 524/65 = ~8 hours/day).
  
* ```daily_fuel_consumed.csv```: This 1417-by-366 matrix contains the total fuel consumed (in L) on each of the identified route segments with at least one flight during 2024 (indexed 1 through 1417) for each day of the year.
  
* ```daily_route_passengers.csv```: This 1417-by-366 matrix contains the total number of passengers that were transported on each of the identified 1417 routes.
  
* ```metrics.csv```: This 2-by-266 matrix contains the total available seat-kms (ASKs) and total revenue passenger-kms (RPKs) produced on a daily basis in the Brazilian Air Transportation System.
  
* ```route_airport_index.csv```: This 1417-by-2 matrix contains the mapping between each of the idenfied routes with at least one flight during 2024, and their respective origin and destination airports (indexed 1 through 169). For example, route #1 operated between airport #1 (ARX) and airport #33 (FOR).
  
* ```route_distances.csv```: This 1417-by-1 matrix contains the average distance (in km) for each of the identified routes.
  
* ```route_flight_times.csv```: This 1417-by-1 matrix contains the average flight time (in days) for each of the identified routes. For example, for route #1, the average flight time is 0.028 days, or ~40 minutes.

### 2: Optimization Code

**Description:** The FOAA model can be run under two scenarios: on a yearly basis, using ```FOAA_vYB```, or on a daily basis, using ```FOAA_vDB```. The difference between the two, as their name implies, is that the route passenger and aircraft flying time constraints are met either on aggregate for the year, or daily.

**User Action:** To run the code, simply download the desired version, alongside the [Processed Datasets](https://github.com/andyeske/FOAA/tree/main/Processed%20Datasets) folders. Both ```FOAA_vYB``` and ```FOAA_vDB``` require the use of a [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=M3+A+Search+US+Brand&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22845995653&gbraid=0AAAAADimQ3jj4Ag29wWuPvh0gcP5gZAed&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgpzIBhCOARIsABZm7vGEZgRpIldNBFiA50gIS_sXEFHWZnGlusO4OP9ZU0IxiBviV5hoi9gaAhnOEALw_wcB) license, which can be obtained for free for students.

The two FOAA models require minimal set-up. Once they are opened in an appropriate environment, only the 'Step 0' section requires user-editing. In the case of ```FOAA_vYB```, this involves changing the dataset directories and modifiying the sensitivity vector for the load factors.:

  ```
# ------------------------------------------------ #
# Step 0: User-editable Parameters
# ------------------------------------------------ #

# --> Data Directory 
directory = '/Users/andyeske/Desktop/Fall 2025/Optimization Methods/Project/Processed Datasets/'

# --> System-wide Load Factor Sensitivity Vector
LF_vec = [0.8,0.82,0.84,0.86,0.88,0.9,0.92,0.94,0.96,0.98,1]
  ```

In the case of ```FOAA_vDB```, user-editing is required to modify the data directory as well as the sensitivity vector for the days in which the optimization would be solved.

  ```
# ------------------------------------------------ #
# Step 0: User-editable Parameters
# ------------------------------------------------ #

# --> Data Directory 
directory = '/Users/andyeske/Desktop/Fall 2025/Optimization Methods/Project/Processed Datasets/'

# --> Days Sensitivity Vector
# Here, a 0: January 1, 2024, while a 99: April 9, 2024
days_vec = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
  ```

In both cases, depending on the problem complexity, it could be useful to edit some of the Gurobi solver parameters detailed in 'Step 2'.
